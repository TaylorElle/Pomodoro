# Pomodoro

"Using React, make a Pomodoro timer that can have time and break duration edits"

Built using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, and React Hooks

This project gave insight into how to refactor code from one file into many files with dynamic routing. 

For me, the hardest part was making an editable countdown that, when the user pressed play, would simultaneously show how much time was left.
